# Income-Prediction_using-Data-Mining

# Problem Statement and Background
An enormous problem, particularly in the United States, is the stark wealth and income
inequality. The likelihood of diminishing poverty is one valid reason to reduce the world's
surging level of economic inequality. The idea of universal moral equality promotes nationwide
economic stability and guarantees sustainable development.
So the ability to predict income is crucial for governments in several areas of the nonprofit and
corporate sectors. This will have a significant impact on a variety of areas, including marketing,
business, and urban development, where the population's income distribution is an important
element.
In order to address the issue of income inequality, this study demonstrates how data mining tools
can be used. This has been accomplished using the UCI Adult Dataset. Based on a particular set
of characteristics, classification has been done to determine whether a person's yearly income in
the US falls in the income category of greater than 50K Dollars or less equal to 50K Dollars.
This study seeks to determine a person's earning potential based on a number of contributing
factors. The struggle against economic inequality will be aided by this. The use of this model
helps in the completion of a careful analysis that identifies the most important elements in
improving an individual's revenue.

# Lessons Learned
1) Despite being easily available, data isnâ€™t always simple to use. In order to use data to
make any predictions, there are a number of preprocessing steps that need to be
performed.
2) Every algorithm can be used for the dataset but there will be few algorithms that are
accurate for that specific dataset.
3) Hyperparameter tuning might increase the efficiency of an algorithm.
4) While visualizing the data, the correlation between the independent and dependent data
can be identified.
5) Measures like accuracy on the test data and training error can be used to determine
whether the model is to be over-fitted or under-fitted.
